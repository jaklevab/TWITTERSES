# Optimal Proxy Selection for Socioeconomic Status Inference on Twitter
This repository contains code related to the paper [optimal proxy selection for socioeconomic status inference on Twitter](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/marton.karsai/) (currently in submission). An earlier version of this work was also published in the proceedings of the [ICDM'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05389) workshops. 

This repository contains the `Python` codes needed to apply the inference pipeline to similar demographic-enriched twitter data samples.

* code to generate semantics features, reliable home locations and ses-enriched datasets from users tweets and census, is in the [helpers](./python_scripts/helpers) folder

* `Keras` implementations of the `ResNet50` used in this paper to select residential sites are in the [data collection and processing](./python_scripts/data_coll_process) folder (with a `TensorFlow` backend)

* code to train and validate the models, for each socioeconomic proxy in the [pipelines](./python_scripts/pipelines) folder.
